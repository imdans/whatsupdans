# üêß Art , Music and Movies.
---
Hold on , art and music? Isn't this a blog about opensource and programming? Have i gone nuts? (probably i have long ago , but that's a different story.)
Now hold onto your questions because i promise there is a connection and i am not blindly ranting about whatever impulsive thoughts on top of my mind (well i kind of am)

Growing up , i really enjoyed good movies. A good piece of "art" (Movies , music or good stories) really stays with you for a *very* long time. Some movies even really define the way you think , and i have always believed art is a form of liberation. Good art makes you question things , it refines the way you think and hopefully builds you up as a person (or at least , helps you discover what kind of person you want to be)

#### A scene from the movie whiplash

Whiplash was one of the many movies id like to give as an example.
Whats interesting about this movie is , I've heard that depending on the kind of person you ask , everyone has a different interpretation on how the movie ends and if what happens in the movie was right or not.
Now i really don't want to be spoiling this movie for you , so go watch it yourself
The point i wanted to make is , its a good example of how interpretation of art is subjective at its core , but a good piece of art really does leave you with a piece of itself that changes (or at least , has an impact) on the way you think.

Now id like to ask what makes this movie that amazing?
Was it :
- The good writing?
- The amazing cast and the acting
- The music?
- The audience that appreciates movies like these.

And obviously , the answer is all of the above. Good art is made with collaboration , and putting all these pieces together , and of course without a good audience that truly appreciates and understands is also crucial.


#### Hotline Miami and undertale.

Both these games are VASTLY different in tone , direction and music choice.
and I've enjoyed both of them equally 
Undertale was basically one guy making everything , amazing music and excellent writing. But the audience is a very huge reason for the recognition the game got.

Hotline Miami was made by two people and it was really dark and gritty in natures with really gut wrenching and blood pumping music , you play as the character jacket and start butchering everyone in the room until they all die.
i swear its a good game with good story and not only meant for psychopaths :)

now we see how a good piece of art is made using such basic tools , good writing , good music and all the people that come together to make and appreciate it.

# Open-source and programming
---

Now , i might be nuts , but in my opinion open-source and the way good art functions is REALLY similar.
You might call me nuts because if you try hard enough you can draw parallels anywhere you want
(maybe you'll say how being a serial killer and making art are "very similar things") but this is something i enjoy believing in.

#### The Linux headquarters (well not really but its funny to say so)

Open-source is more than just "code available openly for everyone to see" and "bro it will help in my resume". while both these definitions are true , what really pumps life into enjoying open source is the **collaboration** of a community coming together , piecing things together that really add meaning to the thing and an **audience** that can truly appreciate these lines of code coming together creating something beyond just text on your screen.

Open-source is not just a bunch of programmers creating things , you can be a part of open source even if you are just a *user* of something that's open source.
If you write music for anyone to use with a free license , if you write open source textbooks and if you really appreciate the freedom that comes along with making things open , you are an open source enthusiast.

You enjoy good art. and it will help change the way people create and share things.
Open-source can be life changing and you probably use things that were built on open source software:

#### Android and Krita are both open source.

and finally, open-source really makes programming fun. i'm not saying programming by itself is not fun , its a very fun tool to play with , but open-source is what in one of the many ways truly makes it art.

and plus , closed source CANNOT look this cool :

# üêß Art , Music and Movies.
---
Hold on , art and music? Isn't this a blog about opensource and programming? Have i gone nuts? (probably i have long ago , but that's a different story.)
Now hold onto your questions because i promise there is a connection and i am not blindly ranting about whatever impulsive thoughts that are on the top of my mind (well i kind of am)

Growing up , i really enjoyed good movies. A good piece of "art" (Movies , music or good stories) really stays with you for a *very* long time. Some movies even really transform the way you think , and i have always believed art is a form of liberation. Good art makes you question things , it refines the way you think and hopefully builds you up as a person (or at least , helps you discover what kind of person you want to be)

#### A scene from the movie whiplash

Whiplash is one of the many movies id like to give as an example.
Whats interesting about this movie is , I've heard that depending on the kind of person you ask , everyone has a different interpretation on how the movie ends and if what happens in the movie was right or not.
Now i really don't want to be spoiling this movie for you , so go watch it yourself
The point i wanted to make with this example is that interpretation of art is subjective at its core , but regardless ,  a good piece of art really does leave you with a piece of itself that changes (or at least , has an impact) on the way you think.

Now id like to ask what makes this movie , or any piece of art,  that amazing?
Was it :
- The good writing?
- The amazing cast and the acting?
- The music?
- An audience that appreciates movies like these?

And obviously , the answer is all of these things piece together to create art . Good art is made with collaboration , and putting all these fragments together. and of course without a good audience that truly appreciates and enjoys such art , it loses some of its meaning.

#### Hotline Miami and undertale.

Both these games are VASTLY different in tone , direction and music choice.
and I've enjoyed both of them equally.
Undertale was basically a one man show , amazing music and excellent writing. What really set this game apart is the charm it has , and an audience that refuses to die (um... for the better or for the worse). Hence , good art , gives you a piece of itself that stays with you.

Hotline Miami , polar opposite of undertale in many ways , was made by two people. its really dark and gritty in nature and has really gut wrenching and blood pumping music.
**you play as the character jacket and start butchering everyone in the room until they all die.**
despite that scary description its actually a game meant not just for psychopaths but for every indie game loving nerd out there.

now we see how  a good piece of art is made using such basic tools: good writing , good music , a strong direction , and all the people that come together to make and appreciate it.

# Open-source and programming
---

Now , i might sound really nuts , but in my opinion open-source and the way good art functions is REALLY similar.
You might disagree with me (and that's totally fine) because if you try hard enough you can draw parallels anywhere you want
(maybe you'll say how being a serial killer and making art are "very similar things" , im looking at you , weirdo dahmer and dexter fans) 
but this is something i enjoy believing in.

Open-source is more than just "code available openly for everyone to see" and "bro it will help in my resume". while both these definitions are technically true , what really pumps life into everything open source is the **collaboration** of a community coming together , piecing things together that really add meaning to something valuable , and an **audience** that can truly appreciate these lines of code or open source sound files or anything else , coming together creating something beyond just text on your screen. something that we as an audience can enjoy and truly have ownership over , as a community.

Open-source is not just a bunch of programmers contributing code , you can be a part of open source even if you are just a *user* of something that's open source. 
If you write music for anyone to use with a free license , if you write open source textbooks and if you really appreciate the freedom that comes along with making things open , you are an open source enthusiast.

You enjoy good art. and it will help change the way people create and share things.
Open-source can be life changing and you probably use things that were built on open source software:

#### Android and Krita are both open source or based on open source tech.

and finally, open-source really makes programming fun. It gives us an opportunity to really enjoy programming and give it some meaning. imagine how boring math would be if you were forced to cram it down your throat (oops.....sounds familiar). i'm not saying programming by itself is not fun , its a very fun tool to play with , but open-source is what in one of the many ways truly makes it art.

and plus , closed source CANNOT look this cool :

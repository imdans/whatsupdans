# This weird logo
---
 Honestly , the main purpose of this logo is that , its a good conversation starter. when you look at it you probably go "what the hell is that thing?" , or if you are a kinder person you'd probably go "where is that background from?" or "why is he wearing a helmet?" (honestly even i don't know why i drew a helmet on)
 The map in the background you see is a custom map from Counter-Strike 1.6 (The alley), it was game i really enjoyed as a kid. The reason i got into this game was half-life and valve. 
 Half-Life is probably the reason i love games and computers so much. it was amazing how such a low-spec game which ran on literally anything (when i got my hands on a laptop GTA-5 was already a thing) was so amazing. I used to think good games always meant good graphics and whatnot , but Half-life and games like GTA SA really proved that what mattered the most was good writing and direction. 
 From Half-life i started playing other low-spec games , Undertale , stardew valley , To the moon (AMAZING GAME BTW). And all of them ran on my glorious Thinkpad T60. 
 
# My Thinkpad T60

(The photo above is not mine but it looked exactly the same)

This BEAST of a laptop had:
- 2 gigs of RAM
- a 32- bit , 2 GHz intel processor
- and the infamous thinkpad nipple 

Thinkpad T60 was back in the era when IBM and Lenovo used to make these machines together. And they were actually really great machines. sadly a great machine from 1995 is no longer a great machine in 2013. But it was regardless , a good machine. Over the course of years it had endured all the torture i put it through , wiping its hard drive a billion times , dismantling the thing whenever i wanted it to and it falling onto the ground at least a hundred times.

Now since it had a 32-bit CPU , it couldn't really run every software that you could find online. By then most laptops and companies were ditching 32-bit cpus in favor of the now dominant 64-bit
Basically , all it could run was papas freezeria on a slowly dying web browser (and i still love you , Firefox). 
Now when all your laptop can do is work like a glorious room heater , you want to get something more out of it. I started finding ways to get the most out of this machine and the very next day , Windows-7 bootloader broke.
This wasn't the first time it happened and the bitches who fixed it , didn't fix it for free.
So i started looking at ways to fix it myself and that's when i discovered Linux.

Installing Linux was not that hard and once you understand how it works its really easy. My choice was Debian because it had good support for 32-bit cpus , Ubuntu and co were phasing away from 32-bit support back then to 64-bit only.

Years later if my device fully supports Linux , its still my OS of choice. and don't get me wrong , i don't hate windows , i used to love windows 7 , but oh man.....

- ## Mandatory online account
- ## cannot disconnect from internet during setup
- ## Sometimes your network driver wont even be preinstalled so you HAVE to use Ethernet.
- ## And an installer that's still stuck in the 2000's




# And finally , the purpose of this blog
---
There is no purpose for this blog.
i like writing and ranting and this is a very fun way of doing it.
i'll try writing about things i like every week or so and that's actually good enough purpose for me.

- ## The map in the background is from Half-Life , a game i really enjoyed as a kid. Half-Life is probably the reason i love games and computers so much. 
- ## From Half-life i started playing source engine based games , G-mod , Counter Strike 
- ## Regardless , i was trash at the game. but i enjoyed it. and that's what matters the most

## This was my laptop for atleast 8 years.my dad bought this in 2015 , and i dont know who scammed him but it had a 32 bit cpu , and that was right when 32 bit architecture was being abandoned in favour of the now preferred 64 bit (or ARM???)
## Basically , all it could run was papas freezeria on a slowly dying web browser. surprisingly it could still run windows 10 tho.

## However , when you have a weak device + you're pretty jobless + you REALLY want to play some games , you start exploring your options.
## I began with trying to run windows 7 , much better experience than 10 but there is only so much a laptop with 2 gigs of RAM can provide you.

## That's when i started messing around with linux , now contrary to whatever opinion existed about linux around that time (this was when proton and co didn't exist) , installing  it was actually pretty darn easy. it was like installing any other software off the web.

## Infact , installing windows 11 these days is DEFINITLEY much harder
